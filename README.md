Based on a suggestion from [Erwin van der Koogh](https://github.com/evanderkoogh).

This project attempts to replicate the functionality of [Cloudflare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) with [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects) as the underlying persistent Key-Value Store, rather than Quicksilver.

This is still very much a work-in-progress, but any additions are very much appreciated! Documentation will come at some point(hopefully, ðŸ¤ž).
